# QCNN
Hybrid  Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) using PennyLane and PyTorch for binary classification. It integrates quantum feature extraction, convolution, and pooling with classical layers. The model trains with `CrossEntropyLoss` and `Adam` optimizer. Future improvements include multi-class support and optimized quantum circuits.
